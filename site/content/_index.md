## Introduction to Diwise

diwise is an open source IoT communications platform that acts as a mediator between underlying sensor platforms and high level business systems. This means that the business tools and processes can be separated from the low level details of different communication interfaces and sensor types.

The idea behind this platform originated 2018 during the [Good Tech Hack](https://www.goodtechhack.se/) hackathon in [Sundsvall](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/10276532), [Sweden](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/52822). A cross functional team from [Masarin Consulting Group](https://masarinconsulting.se) wanted to make the city of Sundsvall more accessible, by aggregating different sources of data and provide it to the citizens. The idea was pitched to Sweden's innovation agency, [Vinnova](https://www.vinnova.se/en/), who funded a project named [IoT for accessibility](https://www.vinnova.se/en/p/iot-for-accessibility/) to continue working on the idea in cooperation with Sundsvalls Kommun.

Long story short, after the project ended the name diwise was chosen, as a wordplay on digital wisdom, and the development now continues under the https://github.com/diwise organisation on GitHub.

## What can i find here?

On this site we will publish technical documentation about the platform and its components. The intention is to provide a more cohesive view of the platform from a technical perspective, than can typically be created when the information is scattered across 50-something different repositories.

For more high level non technical information we have a website (in swedish) at https://diwise.se.
